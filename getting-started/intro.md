In this scenario you will learn about Firecracker, a secure, multi-tenant, minimal-overhead execution of container and function workloads.

You will learn how to:

* Deploy Firecracker

* Start an Alpine based instance using Firecracker

* Login and explore instance

## What is Firecracker?

Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based services that provide serverless operational models. Firecracker runs workloads in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the speed and flexibility of containers.
